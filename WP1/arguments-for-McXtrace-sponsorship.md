McXtrace is a ray tracing package for simulating virtual X-ray experiments. ExPaNDS partners (such as SOLEIL)  collaborate on developing the Software.  
McXtrace is open source, licensed under the General Public License, and does not require the user to have access to any proprietary software for its operation. The structure of the software is described in detail, and various examples are given to showcase the versatility of the McXtrace procedure and outline a possible route to using Monte Carlo simulations in data analysis to gain new scientific insights. Both reasons make McXtrace easity accesible to the whole PaN (ExPaNDS) community.  
The project contributes also strongly to educate engineers (BSc, BEng, MSc) and researchers (PhD) and supports life-long learning within science and technology in line with the key objectives of the ExPaNDS projet.
