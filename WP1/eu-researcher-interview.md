Questions sent by Patrick from EU researcher journal for the interview on Feb 8,2022. Collecting here thoughts on answers.

> 1. Could we just start by getting an understanding of the project's overall aims and objectives? Is Expands essentially about enabling wider access to information on photons and neutrons, would this help more scientists participate in research and share their expertise? 

FAIR, EOSC, national RIs missing from PaNOSC. Example.

> 2. Is the data generated by synchrotron experiments relevant to quite a wide variety of fields? Who do you expect will be interested in the data from these experiments, is it relevant to both applied research and fundamental science? 

Yes from heritage science to life science and material research, everything that needs to be looked at with a super microscope. Applied research: batteries + BioNTech vaccines. Fundamental: 

> 3. Is quite sophisticated equipment typically required to conduct research into photon and neutron behaviour, are some researchers limited in their access to this equipment? Do you aim to help widen access to data? 

not sure I get this one. Known problem of some labs that can't afford proprietary software for data analsyis in specific fields. otherwise it's open calls so wveryone should be able to access our instruments and 'only' need to bring their probe along.

> 4. Do existing research infrastructures like the diamond light source and the ALBA synchrotron have similar facilities, do they complement each other? Do you have both high energy physics machines and sources of synchrotron light in the project?  

Each facility has its specialties, in wavelenght, in luminosity, even neutron and photon complement each other (photo of the telephone). And inside the facility, again each beamline has its own community / application / possibilities. Commonalities too of course. Prepare some examples.

> 5. Is the project aiming to develop a more standardised approach to data collection and data management at photon and neutron facilities? Do different facilities currently have different policies, do they generate different types of data?     

oh yes. differences in embargo periods, in curation policy, in the use of DOIs, even in who is owning the data. Whole point of trying to standardise policies is that we have users using several of our facilities (because of the above mentioned complementarity of instruments) and we want to make their life easier.
About the types of data generated, mention efforts towards NeXus.

> 6. Are you providing access to both data from experiments, and also the subsequent analysis of that data by different groups of researchers? How can you ensure that data is provided in a way that meets the FAIR principles?  

yes we want to make analysis workflows also available along with the open data. Make the data produced by our facilities as FAIR as possible by default. Then it lies in the hands of the researchers but we can already make a lot.

> 7. Is the project aiming to provide shared access to data from current day experiments, as well as  experiments that have already been conducted? Do the research infrastructures have extensive archives of data, will this be provided on an open access basis?

will be left to the researcher. more and more possibilities offered by journals to link data to an already published publication (Elsevier e.g.) so could be an incentive. for us it depends on the policy, we can only make open what was produced when the data policy saying it will be made available after the embargo period was in application.

> 8. Do you expect that shared access to data will help academics work more efficiently and avoid duplicating research? Will scientists be able to re-use data available via EOSC to conduct entirely new research?   

oh yes that's the whole point. prepare examples.

> 9. Is photon and neutron data central to the technologies of the future, for example quantum computers? How important is photon and neutron data to the development of new medicines and new technologies?  

very. examples again.

> 10. Do you have any plans to extend the project beyond its initial term, how do you anticipate your research will evolve in future? Could the Expands project turn into a permanent initiative, will further facilities be added in future?  

god no ;) but mention LEAPS and LENS as permanent initiatives keeping the community together and follow-up projects, we still have a lot to do to keep PaN on top of research data management practices.
