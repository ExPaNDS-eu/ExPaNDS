Questions sent by Patrick from EU researcher journal for the interview on Feb 8,2022. Collecting here thoughts on answers.

> 1. Could we just start by getting an understanding of the project's overall aims and objectives?  

-	More importantly is to understand that the people who wrote the proposal are scientists from the facilities. So besides the objectives stated in the proposal (GA), the main objective was to really make life easier to our beamline scientists. We didn’t want to waste time on ‘theoretical objectives', which might nor might not be of use, but on the daily work of our scientists or customers. And to be noted, the people who met in London are managers from the operation branch of the facility who know what there are talking about. 
-	We only had to bring our objectives in line with the EOSC goals, which wasn’t that difficult as the have a large overlap. 
-	In this context we need to talk about leaps and lens.
- Official objectives are :
  - To deliver the EOSC to the wide variety of Photon and Neutron users 
  - To enable FAIR scientific data at European national RIs 
  - To make national RI data accessible to user communities via the EOSC 
  - To enrich the set of data services available in the EOSC with services from national RIs 
  - To raise the level of awareness and competence in FAIR data practices within user communities 
  - To engage with the EOSC programme to empower national RI user communities and to maintain sustainability 

FAIR, EOSC, national RIs missing from PaNOSC. Example.

> 1.b) Is Expands essentially about enabling wider access to information on photons and neutrons, would this help more scientists participate in research and share their expertise?
-	The question is a bit misleading. We don’t work on information on photons and neutrons. That are the scientists in High Energy Physics.
-	CLEARIFY : What is photon and neutron science
  -	beam, detector, technology, analysis.
  - Why photon and neutron. (common : wave, electric , strong force)
-	Enabling access is not the only objective. But yes it would help in a variety of ways.
-	Science is generally always based on the findings of previous experiments (or evaluations , findings). 
-	So the more information you can collect before you start working on a particular topic the more precise will be your work and the less you have to repeat. 
-	Therefor is essential that you can find and understand the work which was done in the past.
-	This is somehow evident in the particular field, but the hope of the commission is to allow other areas to benefit from the science done at the photon and N. facilities. 
-	Looking more in details: Even the parameter space you start you work with can be significantly reduced which lowers costs and efforts. Which is particularly important of you instrument is expensive. 
   -	Sophie recently reported on a use case with reflectometry were the initial condition of the experiement could be reduced due to previous investigations. 

> 2. Is the data generated by synchrotron experiments relevant to quite a wide variety of fields? Who do you expect will be interested in the data from these experiments, is it relevant to both applied research and fundamental science? 
-	The field are essentially endless. 
-	Wherever you need deep inside into matter you need bright (high energetic) short and brilliant laser pulses. (or high density focused neutron beams.)
-	Besides the different technologies (how you use the beam to make the picture) there is on the high level :
  - Medicine, Behaviour of protein structures in new medication
  - Biology, DNA and viruses. 
  - Material, make them stronger and lighter, reduce aging. 
  - Behaviour of especially water, which is becoming significant in the future.  
  - New Technologies, like quantum and batterie science
  - Culturual Heritage, non invasive investiations of very old material , picture and documents. 
- Official objectives are :
  - To deliver the EOSC to the wide variety of Photon and Neutron users 

Yes from heritage science to life science and material research, everything that needs to be looked at with a super microscope. Applied research: batteries + BioNTech vaccines. Fundamental: 

> 3. Is quite sophisticated equipment typically required to conduct research into photon and neutron behaviour, are some researchers limited in their access to this equipment? Do you aim to help widen access to data? 

not sure I get this one. Known problem of some labs that can't afford proprietary software for data analsyis in specific fields. otherwise it's open calls so wveryone should be able to access our instruments and 'only' need to bring their probe along.

> 4. Do existing research infrastructures like the diamond light source and the ALBA synchrotron have similar facilities, do they complement each other? Do you have both high energy physics machines and sources of synchrotron light in the project?  

Each facility has its specialties, in wavelenght, in luminosity, even neutron and photon complement each other (photo of the telephone). And inside the facility, again each beamline has its own community / application / possibilities. Commonalities too of course. Prepare some examples.

> 5. Is the project aiming to develop a more standardised approach to data collection and data management at photon and neutron facilities? Do different facilities currently have different policies, do they generate different types of data?     

oh yes. differences in embargo periods, in curation policy, in the use of DOIs, even in who is owning the data. Whole point of trying to standardise policies is that we have users using several of our facilities (because of the above mentioned complementarity of instruments) and we want to make their life easier.
About the types of data generated, mention efforts towards NeXus.

> 6. Are you providing access to both data from experiments, and also the subsequent analysis of that data by different groups of researchers? How can you ensure that data is provided in a way that meets the FAIR principles?  

yes we want to make analysis workflows also available along with the open data. Make the data produced by our facilities as FAIR as possible by default. Then it lies in the hands of the researchers but we can already make a lot.

> 7. Is the project aiming to provide shared access to data from current day experiments, as well as  experiments that have already been conducted? Do the research infrastructures have extensive archives of data, will this be provided on an open access basis?

will be left to the researcher. more and more possibilities offered by journals to link data to an already published publication (Elsevier e.g.) so could be an incentive. for us it depends on the policy, we can only make open what was produced when the data policy saying it will be made available after the embargo period was in application.

> 8. Do you expect that shared access to data will help academics work more efficiently and avoid duplicating research? Will scientists be able to re-use data available via EOSC to conduct entirely new research?   

oh yes that's the whole point. prepare examples.

> 9. Is photon and neutron data central to the technologies of the future, for example quantum computers? How important is photon and neutron data to the development of new medicines and new technologies?  

very. examples again.

> 10. Do you have any plans to extend the project beyond its initial term, how do you anticipate your research will evolve in future? Could the Expands project turn into a permanent initiative, will further facilities be added in future?  

god no ;) but mention LEAPS and LENS as permanent initiatives keeping the community together and follow-up projects, we still have a lot to do to keep PaN on top of research data management practices.
