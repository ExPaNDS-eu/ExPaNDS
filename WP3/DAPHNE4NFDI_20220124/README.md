# Summary

The data volumes and data rates generated by state-of-the-art high frame rate multi-megapixel detectors demand new approaches to how users manage their experimental data. There is a desperate need for user-oriented tools to help users manage their large datasets, from data collection through to analysis, publication and long-term archiving. Meanwhile, the trend to request data associated with publications be made openly available and repeatable the development of user-focused tools to facilitate and simplify this process. This satellite engages with users to determine the data management tools needed to improve their research data management workflows. It forms a part of the Daphne4NFDI project, an initiative funded as a part of the German NFDI program to develop infrastructures to serve the future data management needs of the photon and neutron science community.
