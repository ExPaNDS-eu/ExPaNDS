## ExPaNDS meeting for task 3.4 & 3.5
Wednesday 09 February 2022

## Agenda
**Task 3.4:**
- Discuss Workshop on Different Metadata Catalogues - tentative date in April/May

**Task 3.5:**
- Present doodle result and set a date for workshop
- Discuss setting up the event, invitation or any other details
- AOB

## Discussion & Decisions

### For Task 3.4

Rolf suggested that SciCat and ICAT can be presented with emphasis on the differences between them and known pros and cons. This however presents the challenge that in general everyone has experience with one but not the other. A preparatory meeting to discuss the two different catalogues may help. No other catalogue was brought up as a candidate for the workshop.

#### Decision:

* A half day workshop on SciCat and ICAT is to be planned. 
* Need to find presenters. Carlo volunteered to present SciCat. Mathew will check Alejandra's availability for ICAT.
* A preparatory meeting needs to be planned.
* Suggested date in Early April (before Easter) or late April to May

### For Task 3.5

Marta presented the doodle result for the date of the workshop. The format and content of the workshop will largely follow the previous workshop conducted for PaNOSC. Finer details to be discussed with presenters.

#### Decision:

* Date for workshop is set on March 24, 2022
* Invite all ExPaNDS.
* Need to setup an Indico Workshop page for registration since workshop is open to all.
