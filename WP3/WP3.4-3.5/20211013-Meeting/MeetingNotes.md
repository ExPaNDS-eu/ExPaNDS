## ExPaNDS meeting for task 3.4 & 3.5
Wednesday 13 October 2021

## Agenda:
For task 3.5
 - Clarify the questions we have in WP3 monthly meeting.
 - Discuss about Umbrella ID.

For task 3.4
 - Discuss how to assess gaps and issues with the advancement in the
  KPIs in the partner facilities.

Discuss the next steps for both tasks.

## Discussions & Decisions

### For task 3.5
From the WP3 monthly meeting we know that the federated search API doesn't have support for authentication. Our assumption is then that the federated search API will be used for public data only. This also means there is no need to integrating umbrella ID to federated search API.
However, we will try to integrate umbrella ID at the facility level (local metadata catalogue).

**Decision:** Intergrate Umbrella ID at the facility level.

### For task 3.4
From previous meeting we decided that part of this task should be about coordinating and helping ExPaNDS partners so that they could achive the KPI targets. In order to help the facilites we need to understand the problems they have. The information we need from each facility are:
- Which KPIs has been archived? (Could be gathered from preivous KPIs survey?)
- Which KPIs does the partner intended to archive before the end of project?
- What are the road blockers that hampering the partner the most from advancing?
- What could be done to help?
- Identify up to 3 issue that ExPaNDS could help.

Depend on the outcome of the assessment ExPaNDS could take different actions to help.

- If there are common issues we could try to do a joint effort in form of workshop or something similar.
- If we find a diversity of issues we could help by organizing exchange of experience between ExPaNDS partners.
The gap and issue assessment could be done through online survey or an informal meeting or both.

**Decisions:**
- Perform gap and issue assessment with more targeted questions on partners obstacles.
- In case of informal meeting, ExPaNDS partners will receive the questionnaire before the meeting so they can prepare the answers in advance.

## Next steps
For task 3.4
- Create a set of questions for gap and issue assessment.
- Decide how to organize the assessment. Online? Informal meeting? or both?

For task 3.5
- Organize a workshop about Umbrella ID and Keycloak.
- Assisting ExPaNDS partners with Umbrella ID intergration.

## Upcoming events
- Session for gap and issue assessment. Date to be decided at the end of November.
- Workshop for Umbrella ID and Keycloak.

**Next meeting on 27 October 2021 at 15:00.**
- Discuss the questions to ask in the survey.
- Ideas for the workshop and decide the date for the the workshop.
